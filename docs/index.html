<h4 id="non-magic-perks">non-magic perks</h4>
<p>any character can pick any of these non-magic perks, as long as they don't choose the magic-user career.</p>
<p>each perk gives +1 to any roll related to it, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>pick two (you can't pick the same perk twice):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>blade master</em>: fighting with a sword or sword-like, axe (can be extended to any melee weapon if the <strong>gm</strong> agrees),</li>
<li><em>projectile master</em>: fighting using a ranged weapon - sling, bow, etc.</li>
<li><em>nimble fingers</em>: picking locks, disarming traps, pickpocket, etc.</li>
<li><em>blazing fast</em>: running and initiative.</li>
<li><em>expertise</em>: choose a specific field of knowledge (science?) where you are an expert. the <em>gm</em> has to agree on this field description.</li>
<li><em>diehard</em>: when rolling for a save.</li>
<li><em>tough</em>: no bonus, but add an extra degree of health, &quot;scratched&quot;.</li>
<li><em>contact</em>: no bonus ; the player should describe a contact which provides useful services at no or reduced costs (information, material, etc). the <strong>gm</strong> has to agree on the description.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="meat">meat</h3>
<p>the <strong>gm</strong> should talk to the players about their characters.<br />
where do they come from? what's their story?<br />
do they have goals? a quest to fulfill?<br />
what are their relationships? do they have friends, family, siblings? who are their enemies? what do they fear the most?</p>
<h2 id="act">act</h2>
<p>if it's likely, it happens.<br />
if it's impossible, it doesn't.<br />
only roll if the <strong>gm</strong> has doubts.</p>
<p>roll 2d6+<em>domain</em>, include armor or health modifiers when applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>on 6-, failure.</li>
<li>on 7-9, success with a cost.</li>
<li>10+, success at no cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>success: the player describes.<br />
failure: the <strong>gm</strong> decides. the <strong>gm</strong> and other players can suggest the cost for mixed success. the <strong>gm</strong> has the final word.</p>
<h3 id="rerolls">rerolls</h3>
<p>once per session per level, you are allowed to reroll a failure. the reroll result <em>is</em> the definitive result, you are not allowed to reroll a reroll and wait for the next action.</p>
<p><em>optional</em>: the <strong>gm</strong> may allow or forbid rerolls in case of save rolls.</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting">spellcasting</h3>
<p>the magic-user picks a combination of two words of power, one action and one realm, and describes the wanted effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>e.g. kirshan the sorcerer want to combine <em>infirmo</em> (diminish) with <em>navitas</em> (energy) to extinguish a fire that has started in the inn his group was sleeping in. the fire is still small, so the <strong>gm</strong> agrees that the player can roll for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>spells rolls is a 2d6+<strong>lore</strong> using the usual three-tier outcomes. failures can endanger the magic-user or characters around.</p>
<p>if the spell is offensive, your roll against the character <strong>ac</strong> (strictly greater). on a success, opponent decreases one degree of health.</p>
<p>you can roll <em>level</em> x spells per day. you need a full rest to recover your ability to cast spells.</p>
<h3 id="optional-help">optional: help</h3>
<p>helpers roll for the action. one plain success (10+) allows the helped character to reroll if needed.</p>
<h2 id="combat">combat</h2>
<h3 id="initiative">initiative</h3>
<p>at the beginning of the fight: roll 2d6+<em>instinct</em>.</p>
<p>the ones who succeed will act first, then the mixed successful ones, then the failures. each tier will be considered as simultaneous actions.</p>
<h3 id="fight">fight</h3>
<p>on your turn, you are allowed to make one action and one attack.</p>
<p>the action can be: move for a few meters, dodge, jump, take an item from your bag, change your weapon, etc. optionally, you can choose to make two actions ; normal characters can't make two attacks per round.</p>
<p>roll 2d6+<strong>combat</strong> and beat your opponent <strong>ac</strong> (strictly greater). on a hit, the character checks <em>one</em> degree of health.</p>
<p>the reroll rule also applies to attack rolls.</p>
<p>when all degrees are checked, the character is <strong>out of action</strong>, dying. if not healed rapidly, death will come.</p>
<p>make a save check each round. on a failure, the character dies.</p>
<h3 id="save-check">save check</h3>
<p>when you're facing a dreadful danger, are <em>out of action</em>, poisoned or charmed, you'll have to roll 2d6 <strong>with no modifier</strong>. a result of 6- means failure, there's no mixed success.</p>
<p>failure usually means death.</p>
<h3 id="optional-heavy-weapons">optional: heavy weapons</h3>
<p>heavy weapons, such as two-handed swords or battle-axes: you'll suffer a -1 malus, but <em>two</em> degrees are checked on a hit.</p>
<h3 id="optional-critical-hits--failures">optional: critical hits &amp; failures</h3>
<p>on a double 1, or &quot;snake eyes&quot;: you fail miserably and your opponent hits you (check <em>one</em> degree).</p>
<p>on a double 6, or &quot;crowns&quot;: you succeed and double your damages. optionally, you can choose to hit two targets instead of one.</p>
<h2 id="experience">experience</h2>
<p>the <strong>gm</strong> must reward clever choices and decisions, taking risks is okay, but lucky dice rolls would be the reward, not experience points. reward acting as a group, following the character's goals, quests or dreams.</p>
<p>surviving is already a reward in itself.</p>
<p>at the end of their first adventure, they'll become level 2.</p>
<p>when they'll accomplish their common goal, they'll become level 3.</p>
<p>when they'll fulfill their personal quest, they'll become level 5.</p>
<p>when they'll have saved the lives of a whole kingdom, they'll become level 8.</p>

<h1 id="game-masters">game masters</h1>
<h2 id="foes--monsters">foes &amp; monsters</h2>
<p>foes are defined by their:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>power</strong>: modifier to apply to all actions,</li>
<li><strong>ac</strong>: armor class - <em>mov</em> modifiers apply for physical maneuvers.</li>
<li><strong>wounds</strong>: health degrees - if their starting wound is below 5, the <strong>gm</strong> won't have to apply the usual health modifier for the <strong>npc</strong> actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="should-they-fight">should they fight?</h3>
<p>fighting should not be the automatic options when <strong>pcs</strong> are encountering a foe or a monster. they can try to discuss, negotiate, bribe, flee, sneak behind them, etc. let the players be creative. prepare for the unexpected.</p>
<p>monsters are here for a reason. they're not <strong>xp</strong> livestock. they're not here to be killed. they can be afraid. they can flee. they can have a strategy. maybe they could see the <strong>pcs</strong> offer as a chance to escape their miserable life. or they're just hungry.</p>
<p>monsters have motivations. don't ignore this.</p>
<h3 id="morale-checks">morale checks</h3>
<p>when the situation is taking a bad turn for the foes, the <strong>gm</strong> can make a morale check. this situation could be one of this non-exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>they were outnumbering the <strong>pcs</strong>, but now the situation is reversed,</li>
<li>they're badly hurt, or threatened by a big danger,</li>
<li>the <strong>pcs</strong> have a special protection against which they can't do anything,</li>
</ul>
<p>whenever the <strong>gm</strong> feels the need to check the foes reaction, roll d6. if the foes <strong>power</strong> is negative, roll two dice and keep the lowest.</p>

<h2 id="traps">traps</h2>
<p>the <strong>gm</strong> has to make sure they know every details about traps.</p>
<p>traps have a <em>location</em> (where is the &quot;thing&quot; that hurts), a <em>trigger mechanism</em> (where is it located? how does it triggers the trap?) and an <em>effect</em> (blades, darts, pit, poison, gas, agressive spell, crushing rocks or moving walls, etc).</p>
<p>with all these elements at hand, the characters would only get out of it if the players have to thoroughly searched for them to make sure they can detect, disarm or bypass the traps without being hit.</p>
<p>depending on their <em>effect</em>, traps will make from 1 to 3 wounds.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="notes">notes</h1>
<h2 id="design-notes">design notes</h2>
<h3 id="minimalism">minimalism</h3>
<p>small is beautiful. less is more. you can &quot;play pretend&quot; with almost no rule. rpgs can be <a href="https://brunobord.github.io/micro-rpg-catalog/six-word-rpg.html">six word long</a>, and still carry enough material to start a decade-long campaign.</p>
<p>less rules means more room for improvisation, rulings and flexibility, without hindering the flow of the game. you don't have to dig into a 300-page rulebook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;can my character dive in from this cliff in the ocean?&quot;<br />
&quot;let me see... okay, roll 2d6 and add your <em>instinct</em> mod, we'll work out, but you might be warned: it's dangerous, there's a high risk to get hurt.&quot;<br />
&quot;ok, let me dive, the orcs are behind me, there's no other way out&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there's no rule for that, no damage table depending on the height of the cliff or the water temperature. the <strong>gm</strong> is more tempted to say &quot;yes&quot; and let the players write the story for their characters.</p>
<p>you can get your head around the basic mechanism and houserule in a snap.</p>
<p>but <strong>beware!</strong> less rules means more effort for the <strong>gm</strong> and the players to build around the characters and the scenes, it means more freedom, so it means more choice to make.</p>
<p>minimalism doesn't mean it's easier.</p>
<h3 id="dice">dice</h3>
<p><em>microsr</em> only uses d6.</p>
<ul>
<li>six-siders are ubiquitous. you can foster any boardgame in anybody's house. and if your friends' house doesn't have any boardgame or dice to loot... well... maybe it's time for you to reconsider your relationship.</li>
<li>the sum of two d6 offers an interesting bell curve, easy to grasp and the three-tier success ladder from Apocalypse World is a solid tool to randomize results with a variety of outputs. it's not just &quot;success vs. failure&quot; with definitive odds.</li>
<li>little math, and the satisfaction to &quot;roll high&quot; to win. &quot;roll under&quot; is nice, but it's easier to grasp for new players to understand that <em>higher is better</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>it's nothing revolutionary, for sure.</p>
<p>there are plenty of d6-based systems. <em>microsr</em> could have been &quot;yet-another-d20-system&quot; but... if you need a micro osr roleplaying game, simply buy the first edition of <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/178359/The-Black-Hack">The Black Hack</a>, by David Black, for example.</p>
<h3 id="domains">domains</h3>
<p>stats usually represent the inherent abilities of a character. fine.<br />
skills usually represent the <em>acquired</em> abilities, due to their background, training, experience. good.</p>
<p>both are great. both will give coherent characters, add some spice to the game and allow players to make choices on the actions of their characters (<em>&quot;shall we do 'x'? my bonus is 'y' so we're confident or doubtful...&quot;</em>).</p>
<p><em>domains</em> are a bit different ; some are purely inherent abilities (<em>instinct</em>), some are purely acquired (<em>lore</em>), but to some extent, they're both acquired &amp; inherent. maybe your character is gifted for <em>combat</em> because of their huge muscle mass, or maybe that's because they've followed some training... or both! <em>lore</em> works the same: you've been educated so you know stuff, but you've also been chosen to have lessons because somebody has perceived your excellent memory and capacity to learn...</p>
<p>here, there's no <em>int</em> or <em>cha</em> stat. player skills prevails for these.<br />
for example: the intelligence of the player prevails when you need to solve a puzzle or decipher an enigma. how would you represent the fact that the <em>player</em> knows the answer and not the character? and what about the opposite?</p>
<p>and, as expected, there's no perception-related check stat. you don't roll to see a trap, players have to do their job if they want to survive.</p>
<p>but of course, if you don't want to use domains, switch to the usual sextuor: <em>str</em>, <em>dex</em>, <em>con</em>, <em>int</em>, <em>wis</em>, <em>char</em>, the general mechanics will work.</p>
<h3 id="deadly">deadly</h3>
<p>characters only have 5 &quot;wounds&quot;. a &quot;tough&quot; character would have up to 6 wounds. a normal weapon deals one wound. heavy weapons deal two. traps from one to three wounds.</p>
<p>players would probably think twice before trying to engage in a fight. they'll check for trap.</p>
<p>because the usual dungeon exploration dangers can cripple them very badly, it should be a motivation to avoid them instead of rushing towards them.</p>
<h3 id="freeform-magic">freeform magic</h3>
<p>spell lists are great. really. but there are so many different ways to design them that it becomes more and more complicated as you dig into the details. you've got magic realms, wizardry, sorcery, elementary magic, illusions.</p>
<p>should we have clerics? oh then you'll need to build a pantheon, religions and principles, define heresy, etc.</p>
<p>should we scale them on the level ladder? should we not, and make them more powerful as you level up?</p>
<p>pure freeform magic, on the other hand, is hard to handle. how to say &quot;no&quot; to a player that wants to set the whole castle on fire, just because their character is a wizard?</p>
<p>this <a href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/4by5.html">“four by five magic”</a> is, in my opinion, an elegant mechanism between pure freeform magic and spell lists.</p>
<p>you have magical realms, that act as the core <em>domains</em> of the character, and then actions to apply an effect on the given domain.<br />
they're as vague and as precise as you want. the <strong>gm</strong> can discuss them with the player, and define its limits and how powerful this magic would be. eventually, when the magic-user would level up, they'll be able to throw more powerful spells and more times per day.</p>
<h2 id="colophon">colophon</h2>
<ul>
<li>the six domains were originally inspired by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21359/lite-rpgs-to-run-a-d-d-like-game-session">this forum thread on Story-Game.com</a> about converting D&amp;D using Fate Accelerated approaches.</li>
<li>the magic system is known as <a href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/4by5.html">“four by five magic”</a>, and was especially designed for fudge, but as you can see, it fits every fantasy system.</li>
<li>the 3-tier resolution roll is inspired by the <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/">Apocalypse World</a>, by Vincent Baker, (although this game is not powered by moves and it can't be considered as “PbtA”).</li>
