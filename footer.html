<li>the six domains were originally inspired by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21359/lite-rpgs-to-run-a-d-d-like-game-session">this forum thread on Story-Game.com</a> about converting D&amp;D using Fate Accelerated approaches.</li>
<li>the 3-tier resolution roll is inspired by the <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/">Apocalypse World</a> move resolution (although this game is not powered by moves and it can't be considered as "PbtA").</li>
