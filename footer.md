## colophon

* the six domains were originally inspired by [this forum thread on Story-Game.com](http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21359/lite-rpgs-to-run-a-d-d-like-game-session) about converting D&D using Fate Accelerated approaches.
* the magic system is known as [“four by five magic”](http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/4by5.html), and was especially designed for fudge, but as you can see, it fits every fantasy system.
* the 3-tier resolution roll is inspired by the [Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com/) move resolution (although this game is not powered by moves and it can't be considered as “PbtA”).
